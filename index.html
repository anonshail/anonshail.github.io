                    During my SDE internship at AWS CloudFront with the Fleet Health team, I designed and implemented an automated availability calculation system in Python. This system retrieved metric configurations from an AWS DynamoDB table and queried Amazon's monitoring services based on these configurations to calculate availability for various CloudFront services. Additionally, I developed infrastructure-as-code scripts using AWS TypeScript CDK for DynamoDB setup and data seeding, along with Ruby scripts for synthesizing Apollo environments, DJS jobs, and deployment pipelines. This system not only saved the team 4 hours of manual work per sprint but also provided a dashboard that displayed availability, which was presented weekly in organization-level leadership meetings. I contributed significantly to automating availability calculations for CloudFront services, streamlining processes, and ensuring data-driven decision-making through a comprehensive dashboard, while also enhancing infrastructure management through infrastructure-as-code scripts.
